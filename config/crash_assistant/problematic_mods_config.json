		"msg": "⚠️ <strong>Essential Mod Not Supported</strong>\n\nWe strongly recommend against using Essential (<strong>$JAR_NAME$</strong>) with this modpack. <strong>A free world-sharing alternative is already built-in</strong> using e4mc - click <strong>Share World</strong> in the game menu.\n\n<strong>Why we don't support Essential:</strong>\n• <strong>Technical issues:</strong> We've received multiple user reports of problems when combining Essential with our modpacks, including reports of world corruption. While there is no conclusive evidence of Essential as the definite cause, we do not have the development or support capacity to resolve issues potentially caused by it.\n\n• <strong>Security concerns:</strong> Essential's auto-updater introduces potential security risks that are outside of our control.\n\n• <strong>Ethics:</strong> We object to Essential's inclusion of in-game currency and microtransactions in an otherwise free modding environment.\n\n<strong>If you choose to use Essential anyway</strong>, please understand that you do so at your own risk and will not be eligible for support from our team. To remove this warning, you can open your modpack instance folder, navigate to <strong>config/crash_assistant/problematic_mods_config.json</strong>, and under essential-container, change should_crash_on_startup from true to false."
